## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  it allows us to assign properties of an object or array to variables.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  let {prop1: variable1, prop2: variable2} = object
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  let [ x, y, z] = variable
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  Creating object/array literals assigns either the object/array to one variable.
  Destructuring allows us to create multiple variables that are assigned the values of the object/array.
