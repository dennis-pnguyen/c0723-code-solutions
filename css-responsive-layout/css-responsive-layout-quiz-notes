## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
Points at which a media inquiry is introduced. (eg where things will show up on the screen and your page relative to the viewport size)
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Percentages  are easier to calculate based on the relative viewport/screen size in order for your content to take up the correct amount of space.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
based on CSS rules, source order and specificty of the media rule being lower on the stylesheet.(?)
