A variable is "named storage" for data. can use let or const to declare variables
- How do you **declare** a variable?
Declare variables using the keywords 'const' or 'let'
- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
By using the assignment operator ( = )
- What characters are allowed in variable names?
Letters, digits or $ and _ 'underscore', variables cannot start with a number
- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
Variables generally start with a lowercase character, but for variables with multiple words, we use camelCasing.
- What is the purpose of a string?
Strings are used to insert phrases of words into our code, surrounded by single or double quotes

Boolean is used for logic either true or false. commonly used to store yes or no values.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
Use the assignment operator to assign a new value to the variable without declaring a new variable.
- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
Null represents a nonexistent or invalid object (in JS, typeof null, an object is returned).
Undefined represents a variable that has jsut been declared without any actual arguments.

To help keep debugging code simple. Any short string that helps describes what is being debugged.
