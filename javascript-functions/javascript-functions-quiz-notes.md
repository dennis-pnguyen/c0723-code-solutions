## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
A set of statements that performs a task or circulates a value. Takes an input and returns and output.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
 Start with the 'function' keyword followed by your 'functionName'. 
 Next, 0 or more parameters wrapped in parentheses.
 Open your code block with an opening curly brace {
 Optional return statement (this would end the code block after the return statement).
 Close code block with closing curly brace }
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
you would call your function by invoking the function with the name, and passing your arugment within the parentheses.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
Definition - this is where you would write what the function is to be executing when the function is called.
Call - when you call your function, you are passing arguments through to have the code block within your function run.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
Parameter would be considered a 'placeholder' or a variable whose value is not known until we call the function.
Argument is what is passed through the function and replaces the parameter as it has a value when called in the function.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
Parameters can be used to declare unknown variables and what we want the function to change in terms of its value.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
1. causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
2. Prevents any more coee in the function's code block from being run.
